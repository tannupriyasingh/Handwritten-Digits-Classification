# Handwritten-Digits-Classification


We have implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and to evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits. We used the same network to analyze a more challenging
face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network and a convolutional neural network using the TensorFlow library.


With this task we understood:

• How Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network?

• How to setup a Machine Learning experiment on real data?

• How regularization plays a role in the bias-variance tradeoff?

• How to use TensorFlow library to deploy deep neural networks and understand how having multiple
hidden layers can improve the performance of the neural network?

• How to use TensorFlow library to deploy convolutional neural networks and understand the benefit of
convolutional neural network compared to fully connected neural network?
